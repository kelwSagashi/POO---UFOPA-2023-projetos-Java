# Object-oriented programming projects and examples
Some projects from the Object-oriented programming class at Federal University of Western Par√° - UFOPA.

## Main Program

The main program 

```bash
# name of the file: Main.java

# it has to be the same as the file, with uppercase letters preferably
public class Main{ }
```

## Constructor
The constructor methods help in the construction of the object where to define the attributes of the object/class.

In java, the constructor is done like this:

## Methods
We can call methods as 'actions' or what the object do.

Why?

-Reuse of code: the class/object will use its own data:
    -If you want something from the object it will give you what you need from the object. 
-Delegation of responsibility
